"""
System-Wide Credential Loader for Desktop Machine
==================================================

This file automatically loads OpenAI API credentials from your desktop user profile.
Set it up ONCE on your machine, and it works for ALL projects!

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THIS!):
================================================
Created file at: C:\Users\YourUsername\.openai_credentials
With your API keys inside.

HOW IT WORKS:
=============
When you run the trading bot, this script:
1. Checks your home directory for .openai_credentials
2. Loads the API keys automatically
3. Makes them available to ai_config.py
4. No more copying .env files to every project!

SECURITY:
=========
- The credentials file is in your HOME directory (outside git repos)
- It won't be committed to GitHub
- It's private to your user account only
