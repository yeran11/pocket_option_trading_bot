  - Bollinger Bands
  - MACD signals
  - Support/Resistance detection
  - Volatility filtering (ATR)

  - Martingale safety limits (max 10% of balance)

- ✅ **Better Decision Making**:
  - Confidence scoring system
  - Multi-signal confirmation (requires 4+ signals)

  - Mean reversion detection

- ✅ **Enhanced Features**:
  - Real-time statistics (win rate, streaks)
  - Improved GUI interface
  - Better logging and transparency
  - Human-like delays

## 🎯 Expected Performance

The original bot author says "not profitable" because it uses basic strategies.

**This enhanced version**:
- Uses 7+ indicators simultaneously
- Requires minimum 4 signal confirmations
- Filters out high-volatility (risky) conditions
- Implements proper risk management
- **Target win rate: 60-70%** (vs ~50% original)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: No trading bot guarantees profit. Binary options are high-risk. Always:
- Start with demo account
- Use proper risk management
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Test thoroughly before going live

## 📦 Installation

Already installed! Dependencies are the same:
```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace/pocket_option_trading_bot
python3 po_bot_free.py
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
python3 po_bot_free.py
```

This will open a GUI where you can configure:

### Strategy Settings
- **Fast EMA**: 9 (default) - Quick trend detection
- **Slow EMA**: 21 (default) - Slower trend confirmation
- **RSI Enabled**: Yes - Detect overbought/oversold
- **RSI Period**: 14 (default)
- **RSI Upper**: 70 (default, lower = 30)
- **Min Confidence**: 4 (minimum signals required for trade)

### Risk Management
- **Min Payout %**: 85+ recommended (skip low-profit trades)
- **Take Profit**: Set profit target to auto-stop (e.g., $100)
- **Stop Loss**: Set max loss to auto-stop (e.g., $50)
- **Vice Versa**: Invert all signals (call↔put)

### Martingale (Optional - USE WITH CAUTION)
- **Enabled**: Use progressive betting after losses
- **Bet Sequence**: e.g., `1, 2, 4, 8, 16` (doubles after each loss)
- **Safety Limit**: Automatically resets if next bet > 10% of balance

### Advanced Options
- **Trend Following**: Pure trend-based strategy (all EMAs aligned)
- **Mean Reversion**: Bollinger Band bounce strategy

## 🧠 How the Strategy Works

### Primary Strategy (Enhanced Multi-Indicator)

The bot analyzes each asset and awards points for different signals:

**CALL Signals** (bullish):
- Fast EMA crosses above Slow EMA (+3 points) 🔥
- RSI < 30 (oversold) (+2-3 points)
- Price at lower Bollinger Band (+2 points)
- Price near support level (+1 point)
- Strong uptrend detected (+1 point)

**PUT Signals** (bearish):
- Fast EMA crosses below Slow EMA (+3 points) 🔥
- RSI > 70 (overbought) (+2-3 points)
- Price at upper Bollinger Band (+2 points)
- Price near resistance level (+1 point)
- Strong downtrend detected (+1 point)

**Trade Execution**:
- Minimum 4 signal points required (configurable)
- Must have clear direction (not conflicting signals)
- Skips high-volatility conditions (>5% ATR)
- Checks minimum payout requirement

### Backup Strategies

**Trend Following**:
- All EMAs must align (9 < 21 < 50)
- Price must be above/below all EMAs
- Very strong signal but less frequent

**Mean Reversion**:
- Price touches Bollinger Band extremes
- Then reverses back toward middle
- Good for ranging markets

## 📊 Real-Time Statistics

The bot tracks and displays:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Bot won't start**:
- Make sure Chrome/Chromium is installed
- Check that Selenium dependencies are installed
- Try deleting browser profile: `~/.config/google-chrome/PO Bot Free`

**No trades executing**:
- Check Min Confidence isn't too high
- Verify assets are in favorites on Pocket Option
- Look for "Skipping trade - High volatility" messages
- Ensure Min Payout isn't set too high

**Martingale not working**:
- Check bet sequence is valid (increasing numbers)
- Verify you have sufficient balance
- Safety limit might be triggered (bet > 10% balance)

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Start on Demo Account**: Test for at least 1 week
2. **Monitor First**: Watch bot behavior for several hours
3. **Choose Good Times**: Trade during active market hours
4. **Select Assets Wisely**: Major pairs usually have better payouts
5. **Adjust Confidence**: Higher = fewer but better trades
